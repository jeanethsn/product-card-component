## My process

First, I created the entire HTML structure using sections and divs. Then, I defined all the color variables in the root, make all general styles, prepare fonts and finally, I began to write all the CSS, comparing it with the design image I had. I started with the desktop version and then moved on to the mobile version. I learn how to change images in css depending on the screen.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### Continued development

I want to learn more about grid positioning
